# GSEA Analysis Data from: "Telomere elongation in the gut extends systemic healthspan of zebrafish" (El Mai et al., 2023)

**All data used for this analysis is organized into the following folders:**

1. **Normalized Counts ENSEMBL IDs**: Normalized count reads between the NoCre condition and Wildtype or +Cre conditions. 
2. **Genesets**: genesets used in the analysis, all sourced from UC San Diego and Broad Institute's Molecular Signatures Database <a html = "https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0506580102">(Subramanian, Tamayo, et al; 2005)</a>:

    - Hallmark Gene Sets <a html = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4707969/">(Liberzon et al; 2015, Cell Systems)</a>
    - Fridman Senescence UP <a html = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18711403/">(Fridman et al., 2008) </a>
    - <a html = "https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#/R-HSA-2559582"> Reactome Senscence Associated Secretory Phenotype SASP </a>

3. **GSEA data**: Enriched gene set results (up and down regulated) between the NoCre condition and Wildtype or +Cre conditions.
